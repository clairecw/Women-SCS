  		    <h2>Who are the Big Sisters?</h2>
            <p>The program matches first year women with sophomore, junior, or senior women with the goal of strengthening bonds between women in the CS community. The Big Sister/Little Sister relationship serves as an excellent connection for first years with an upperclassman whom they can go to for friendship, advice, and support. Big Sisters have an opportunity to mentor others and share their experiences and perceptions of computer science.</p>

        <h2>What do Big Sisters and Little Sisters do?</h2>
        <p>The Women@SCS Commitee organizes events so prospective Big and Little Sisters can meet and connect. Then, based on preferences, the commitee matches every freshman with a Big Sister. Various events are held during the year to encourage Big and Little Sisters to bond. The closeness and nature of the relationship is determined entirely by the Big and Little Sister.</p>

        <h2>How can you get involved?</h2>
        <p>Matches are usually made in September at the beginning of the new academic year. At any other time, please contact <a href="mailto:ayerneni@andrew.cmu.edu">Anita Yerneni</a>. </p>
